      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;ve had a passing intrest in radio for years and upon discovering software defined radios (SDR) a few years ago, I was incredibly excited at the potential of these devices. For $30, give or take, you could have a radio dongle that can scan a huge amount of radio bandwidth and do all sorts of neat stuff with that. I set up an adsb receiver and recorded plane tracks locally (as well as shared to adsbexchange) to track police helicopters and other protest air traffic, but then I threw it in a closet (still running) and forgot about it.</description>
